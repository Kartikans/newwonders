<LI>While the three pyramids of the Giza plateau – known as Cheops (The Great Pyramid), Chephren and Mycerinus are the most famous in Egypt, more than 130 other pyramids have been discovered scattered around the area of Ancient Egypt.</LI>
<li>The Pyramids of Giza are the oldest and sole remaining intact wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This list also once included the Lighthouse of Alexandria, Colossus of Rhodes and Statue of Zeus at Olympia – which no longer exist today, plus the scattered remains of the Temple of Artemis in Turkey.</li>
<LI>The Great Pyramid is thought to be constructed of over two million stone blocks that range from two to over fifty tons, though it remains a mystery as to how they were transported. Historians estimate that over 100,000 people were involved in the construction of the Pyramids of Giza, and that they may not have been slaves as once thought but rather paid workers.</LI>
<LI> All pyramids in Egypt, including those built on the Giza plateau, are situated on the west bank of the River Nile because that is where the sun sets every evening, symbolising the realm of the dead.</LI>
<LI> The Pyramids of Giza were once covered in a white casing made of glimmering limestone which was so polished that it would reflect the sun’s rays. Unfortunately overtime the casings have slowly disappeared after becoming loosened by earthquakes and crumbling to rubble or being cut loose and taken to build other structures.</LI>
<LI>Despite the scorching heat that can often be felt in Egypt, the temperature inside the pyramids remains a constant 20 C – the average temperature on earth.</LI>
<LI>Although Egypt and the pyramids are synonymous with hieroglyphics, surprisingly no writing or hieroglyphics of any kind have been found within the Great Pyramid of Giza.</LI>
<LI>Inside the main chamber of the Great Pyramid lies a granite coffer, which all seems perfectly normal until you realise it is made out of one solid piece of granite that is far too large to have fit down the passageway you just squeezed through. This realisation has led historians and archaeological to believe that the Great Pyramid was built around the coffer rather than it being brought inside.</LI>
<LI> A perfect example of how the Egyptians were ahead of their time is in the construction of the cornerstones of the pyramid’s foundations. These were discovered to have been built in a ball and socket construction in case of earthquakes or heat expansion.</LI>
<LI>The Great Pyramid is reported to have once had a swivel door, which though weighing up to 20 tons could be easily pushed open from the inside but was too flush to detect from the exterior.</LI>
