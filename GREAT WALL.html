<LI> Great Wall of China, Chinese (Pinyin) Wanli Changcheng or (Wade-Giles romanization) Wan-li
Ch’ang-ch’eng (“10,000-Li Long Wall”), extensive bulwark erected in ancient China, one of the
largest building-construction projects ever undertaken.</LI>

<LI> The Great Wall actually consists of numerous walls—many of them parallel to each other—built
over some two millennia acrossnorthern China and southern Mongolia.</LI>
 
<LI> The most extensive and best-preserved version of the wall dates from the Ming dynasty 
(1368–1644) and runs for some 5,500 miles (8,850 km) east towest from Mount Hu near Dandong, 
southeastern Liaoning province, to Jiayu Pass west of Jiuquan, northwestern Gansu province.
</LI>
 
<LI> This wall often traces the crestlines of hills and mountains as it snakes across the Chinese 
countryside, and about one-fourth of its length consists solely of natural barriers such as 
rivers and mountain ridges.</LI>

<LI> Nearly all of the rest (about 70 percent of the total length) is actual constructed wall, 
with the small remaining stretches constituting ditches or moats. Although lengthy sections of
the wall are now in ruins or have disappeared completely, it is still one of the more 
remarkable structures on Earth.</LI>

<LI> The Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.</LI>
