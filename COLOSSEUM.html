<LI>Originally it was known as the Amphitheatrum Flavium and you can still see this name on the Colosseum today. Eventually, it just came to be called the Colosseum, referring to any large amphitheater used for sports and entertainment. Though the one in Rome is always capitalized and spelled differently than the generic coliseum.</LI>
<LI>The West Exit was called the Gate of Death because this was the exit that dead gladiators were carried out from.</LI>
<LI>The southern side of the Colosseum collapsed in a massive earthquake in 847.</LI>
<LI>The very first games at the Colosseum, held in 80AD by Emperor Titus, lasted for 100 days and there were over 3000 gladiator fights during them. The very last gladiatorial games were held in 435AD.</LI>
<LI>The Colosseum is a popular destination for botanists. As catalog began to be compiled of the the flora in 1643 and over 337 different species have taken root among the ruins.</LI>
<LI> The wooden floor of the Colosseum was removed and the lower cells would be filled with water for mock naval battles to take place. They weren’t quite as popular as the gladiator battles, so eventually were moved elsewhere and the wooden floor became permanent.</LI>
<LI>In ancient times, the Colosseum would have actually been located on the very outskirts of the city. Back then, the city was built around the banks of the river.</LI>
<LI> The Colosseum appears on the reverse of Italy’s five cent Euro coin. Bonus fun fact: Countries in the Euro Zone can mint their own coins and important monuments from their country of issue appear on their reverse.</LI>
<LI>The marble facade and some parts of the Colosseum were used in the construction of St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City.</LI>
<LI>Even though director Ridley Scott made it through all the red tape and bureaucracy required to film the movie Gladiator at the Colosseum, he decided that there were too many restrictions and that the Colosseum just wasn’t big enough for Hollywood. Instead, he built a replica in Malta at the estimated cost of a cool $1 million.</LI>
