<TH>For centuries, human civilizations across the world have built and
created cities, buildings, monumens, tombs, temples, churches, mosques,
and other structures that continue to inspire awe in millions. Narrowing 
down the world's wonders to only seven is a difficult task.
Luckily, the New7Wonders Foundation took the initiative to compose a list 
of the "new" seven wonders of the world by narrowing down a list of 200 
monuments from around the world, including some of the world's most famous
landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and the Statue of Liberty.
21 finalists were selected from this list, and the top seven were selected
by popular vote.</TH>
